### Angry Whopper
A twin reverb if you fucked it's wife, sister and mother, filmed it and sent it to him on tape. This one is designed to work better on single coils, the cuck of pickups.

You know when you go to the gas station drunk at 12:30 and you need to order all your snacks through the window? Well this has nothing to do with that. Great Marshall Plexi Rock Tone.

Barring the Austin Powers joke this a pair of Fender Twin Rerverbs with some stereo separtation, one with a decent gain boost and the other with a screaming fuzz.

### Crunch Wrap Supreme
Heavy Rock sound based upon a 70s Hi-Watt A little Fizzy and Open

### Crunch Wrap Supreme Extra Meat Extra Cheese

### Moldy Basement
Heavy sound, a little fizzy in the top end, based on a Peavy 5150

Thick sound based on a pair of bogner Uberschalls, some reverb and EQ

Similar to Thicc but with a bit more base emphasis and low end

### DummyThic

Another heavy sound based on Thicc but this time with some stereo separtion not unlike a double tracked guitar part

Based on DummyThick but some minor delay. This setting sounds HUGE.
